# Welcome üñê to the Bing Page

This project is a simple mockup of the Bing search engine homepage created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and design of Bing, including the search bar, background image, and other elements. The page's styling is implemented using CSS to closely mimic the look and feel of the original Bing homepage.
